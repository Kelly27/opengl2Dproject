# opengl2Dproject
The little match girl

This is a group project for Computer Graphics, which designed to apply the 2D graphics techniques. The goal is to create an animted scene using only point, line and polygon graphics primitives.

The setting is on a dark snowy night and the animation lasts for 2 minutes. The project is done in 2D graphics techniques and separated into two parts, non-moving and moving, separating in 4 header files. We used only points (GL_POINTS), lines (GL_POINTS), triangle(GL_TRIANGLES), quads(GL_QUADS) and polygon (GL_POLYGON) primitives. 

Result as below:
